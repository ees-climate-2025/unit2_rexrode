This repository contains datasets and Jupyter Notebooks for use in EES 3506 / 5506 Observing and Modeling Climate Change, taught by Dr. Becki Beadling in the Earth and Environmental Science (EES) Department at Temple University in Fall 2025.

Specifically, the files within this repository contain what is needed for Unit 2 which covers:
* Introduction to Jupyter Lab
* Python Fundamentals
* Introduction to working with spreadsheet-like data stored in Pandas dataframes

1D datasets of observed greenhouse gas concentrations, carbon emissions, global average surface air temperature, and greenland and antarctic mass loss are also contained in this repo.
